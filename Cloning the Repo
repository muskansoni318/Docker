Steps for Cloning the Docker files from Repo to Docker Host-

Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys
Run the following command to see if you already have an SSH key:
ls -al ~/.ssh
Look for files named id_rsa and id_rsa.pub or similar.

Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key (if not present)
If no SSH keys are found, generate one using:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter to accept the default file location.

Optionally, set a passphrase for added security.

Step 3: Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent
Start the agent and add your key:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Step 4: Add SSH Key to Your GitHub Account
Copy your public key to the clipboard:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key.

Give it a title and paste your public key.

Step 5: Test Your Connection
Check the SSH connection to GitHub:

ssh -T git@github.com
If successful, you should see a message like:
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Step 6: Clone the Repository Again
Now, try cloning your repository:

git clone git@github.com:muskansoni318/webapp.git
